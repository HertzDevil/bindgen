# Bindgen - A C++ binding generator

A (as of now) C++/Qt centric binding generator.

## Usage

1. Add bindgen to your `shard.yml` (See below).
2. Run `crystal deps` to install it.
3. Copy or symlink `assets/bindgen_helper.hpp` into your `ext/`.
4. Copy and customize `TEMPLATE.yml`.
5. Run `lib/bindgen/run.sh your_template.yml`

```yaml
dependencies:
  bindgen:
    github: Papierkorb/bindgen
```

**Note**: If you intend to ship the generated code with your shard, you can
replace `dependencies` with `development_dependencies`.

Read the `TEMPLATE.yml` for configuration documentation.

### Development dependencies

* `clang 4.0` development headers and libraries
  * Other versions may or may not work.

### Run-time dependencies

* The library you're wrapping.  That's it.

## Name rewriting rules

The following rules are automatically applied to all bindings:

* Method names get underscored: `addWidget() -> #add_widget`
  * Setter methods are rewritten: `setWindowTitle() -> #window_title=`
  * Getter methods are rewritten: `getWindowTitle() -> #window_title`
  * Bool getters are rewritten: `getAwesome() -> #awesome?`
  * `is` getters are rewritten: `isEmpty() -> #empty?`
  * `has` getters are rewritten: `hasSpace() -> #has_space?`
* On signal methods (For Qt signals):
  * Keep their name for the `emit` version: `pressed() -> #pressed`
  * Get an `on_` prefix for the connect version: `#on_pressed do .. end`
* Enum fields get title-cased if not already: `color0 -> Color0`

## Contributing

1. Talk to `Papierkorb` in `#crystal-lang` about what you're gonna do.
2. You got the go-ahead?  The project's in an early state: Things may change without notice under you.
3. Read the `STYLEGUIDE.md` for some tips.
4. Then do the rest, PR and all.  You know the drill.
